<h1>About MaxMVC</h1>
<p>A lightweight MVC framework made just for fun!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-justify">
MaxMVC is a PHP super-lightweight MVC framework constructed in 2 days, it started as a challenge I got requested, but it ended being a super fun quick journey throughout all the basic nuts and bolts that put a MVC framework to work. To construct it I based myself mostly in my own experience using other frameworks, but also in stackoverflow posts, blogs and youtube videos in an intention to use the best practices out there, and not completely reinvent the wheel.

In this readme file you will find how to use it to construct a basic site. If you are not a documentation reading guy, I recommend you to just download it and check the sample project included "My Favorite Movies" to see how to construct a basic CRUD site using MaxMVC framework.
